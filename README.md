# JAGS spatiotemporal modelling

Syntax used for the paper "JAGS model specification for spatiotemporal modelling" which explores the runtime when running a model that uses 1D nested indexing versus 2D nested indexing (spatial and temporal indices).

2 applications have been presented in the study - an exploration using a simulated data and an exploration using real data (COVID-19 study), named accordingly.
