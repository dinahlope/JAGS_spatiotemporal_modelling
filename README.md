# Spatiotemporal modelling in JAGS

Syntax used for the paper "JAGS model specification for spatiotemporal modelling" which explores the runtime when running a model that uses 1D nested indexing versus 2D nested indexing (spatial and temporal indices).

2 applications have been presented in the study - an experimentation using a simulated data and an experimentation using real data of COVID-19 based on the paper 'Spatiotemporal Bayesian estimation of the number of under-reported COVID-19 cases in Victoria Australia' by Lope and Demirhan. Dataset used in this case study is available on https://github.com/dinahlope/Spatiotemporal_Bayesian_COVID19.
